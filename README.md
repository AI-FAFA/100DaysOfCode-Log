1. Read [join the #100DaysOfCode]() 
2. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
3. #### Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!
4. Change the date in [Rules]() to the date you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. #### Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hastag.
7. Follow [100DaysOfCode]() Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. 
8. Important: (see No.3 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
9. If you find a great, helpful resource that others would benefit from, either submit a Pull Request to add it to the repo, or just tweet at me

# Want to change other habits?
** Check out the [#100DaysOfX Challenges Project](https://www.100daysofx.com/). Changing your habits you are changing your life. Remember that the best time to start is always NOW.

** I recommend that you commit to no more than 2-3 challenges at a time, ideally 2. If you are doing the #100DaysOfCode which involves a lot of mental activity, try the [#100DaysOfHealth](https://www.100daysofx.com/where-x-is/health/), or [#100DaysOfFitness](https://www.100daysofx.com/challenges/) challenges. There is so much more on the site, check all of them out and choose the ones you want to acquire! Languages, writing, meditation, journaling, cooking, and more!
