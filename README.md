* [My_Resources]()

## If you decided to join like me:
1. Check out [the Oficial Site](https://www.100daysofx.com/challenges/) for the #100DaysOfCode movement. 
2. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
3. #### Encourage at least two other people in the challenge on Twitter every day! Pay it forward!
4. Change the date in [Rules]() to the date you've started the challenge.
5. Delete the examples in the log, or comment them out, and start filling it with your own content.
6. #### Tweet your progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hastag.
7. Follow [100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) Twitter Bot that retweets the tweets that contain the #100DaysOfCode hashtag. It's a great way to keep yourself motivated and to participate in the community. 
8. Important: (see No.3 above for a specific rule on this) Encourage others who are doing the same challenge on Twitter or elsewhere - by giving them props when they are posting updates on their progress, supporting them when things get difficult. Thus we will grow a community that is helpful and effective, which will lead to a higher success rate for each person involved. It's also more likely that you will stick to your own commitment, given that you will get acquainted with a couple people (or more) right away.
